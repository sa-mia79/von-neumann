<h1>Differences between Von Neumann Architecture & Harvard Architecture</h1>
<img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-498219?width=1280&size=1 " height="200px"alt="Von_Neumann_Architecture">
<p><b>Von Neumann Architecture : </b>Von Neumann Architecture is a digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept of stored program computers where program stroed in the same memory.this architecture was designed by the famous mathmatician and physicist Jone Von Neumann in 1945.
    <br><br>
    <b>Harvard Architecture : </b> Harvard Architecture is a digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept ehere there are separate storage and separate for instrument and data.It was basically develooped to overcome the battleneck of Von Neumann Architecture.
